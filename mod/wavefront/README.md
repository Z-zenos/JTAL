# Wavefront 3D model activity for Moodle 3.1+

mod_wavefront is a Moodle activity that allows learners to upload and view 3D models in a gallery. It supports Wavefront .OBJ geometry definition file format models, which can be uploaded together with .MTL material textures. The excellent three.js library is used to render models. For anyone interested in 3D rendering, including AR and VR, please do check out the three.js docs.

This module started life as a fork of the Lightbox Gallery plugin.
